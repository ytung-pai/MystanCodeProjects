-----------------------
This program should implement a console program
that draws ASCII art - a rocket.
The size of rocket is determined by a constant
defined as SIZE at top of the file.
Output format should match what is shown in the sample
run in the Assignment 2 Handout.

"""

# This constant determines rocket size. You can change the size here.
SIZE = 3


def main():
    """
    This program uses signs such as " ", "/", "\\", "=", "+", â€œ|"
    to print a Rocket. It also applies to different sizes, such as
    SIZE = 1,2,5,10.
